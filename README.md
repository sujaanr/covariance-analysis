# Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) in Python

This study examines a subset of data from an early childhood longitudinal study conducted between 1998 and 1999. It seeks to analyze the connection between socioeconomic factors and educational outcomes, specifically focusing on reading, math, and general knowledge scores of Kindergarten students over several months. This data, gathered from fall 1998 and spring 1999, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the educational trajectories of young learners as they progress through an academic year, with an emphasis on how these trajectories differ across income groups.


The dataset contains continuous variables that measure academic performance in reading, math, and general knowledge, as well as income category, the sole categorical variable. By examining Kindergarten scores, this study aims to use general knowledge scores as a baseline for evaluating how students' reading and math scores evolve over time in relation to their income group.


Research Question: How does household income influence the development of reading and math skills in young learners, and what does this imply for our understanding and intervention strategies regarding educational disparities?


The findings of this research will contribute to a broader discourse on educational equity and may inform policy decisions that strive to offer equal learning opportunities to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds.
